In order to produce all graphs, simply run Main.py

All graphs included in this file are labels by first the algorithm type: Boosting, DTree (Decision Tree), KNN, NN, and
SVM. THis is then followed by LearningCurve or ValidCurve for the two different types of curves produced. If
LearningCurve is in the filename and the algorithm type is iterative there will be a secondary LearningCurve file with
Times after LearningCurve to denote the learning curve graph that shows the fit times. For Validation Curves it will be
followed by the parameter tuned for. Finally all graph filenames will by ended with either Income or Music denoting
which dataset the graph is for.

Under the folder Data, there are two csv files, income evaluation and music_train. These datasets are the two
interesting datasets chosen to be used when training and tuning the algorithms.
